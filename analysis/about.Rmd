# Abstract
In this study, we developed a statistical Random Forest model to produce the first reach-scale estimate of the global distribution of non-perennial rivers and streams. For this purpose, we linked quality-checked observed streamflow data from 5,615 gauging stations (on 4,428 perennial and 1,187 non-perennial reaches) with 113 candidate environmental predictors available globally. Predictors included variables describing climate, physiography, land cover, soil, geology, and groundwater as well as estimates of long-term naturalised (i.e., without anthropogenic water use in the form of abstractions or impoundments) mean monthly and mean annual flow (MAF), derived from a global hydrological model (WaterGAP 2.2; Müller Schmied et al. 2014). Following model training and validation, we predicted the probability of flow intermittence for all river reaches in the RiverATLAS database (Linke et al. 2019), a digital representation of the global river network at high spatial resolution.

# Accessing study data
The [data repository](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14633022.v1) 
for this study includes two datasets:  

* A geometric network of the global river system where each river segment is associated with:
  * 113 hydro-environmental predictors used in model development and predictions, and 
  * the probability and class of flow intermittence predicted by the model.
* The point locations of the 5,516 gauging stations used in model training/testing, where each station is associated with a line segment representing a reach in the river network, and a set of metadata.

The [Data tab](https://messamat.github.io/globalIRmap/data.html) focuses on our treatment of the two main sources of data for this project:  

* a digital representation of the global river network (RiverATLAS)
* streamflow gauging station records at 5615 locations globally

The [Workflow tab](https://messamat.github.io/globalIRmap/workflow.html) explains the requirements and analytical steps involved in the analysis for this study.\cr
