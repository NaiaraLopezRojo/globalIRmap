# How to use

## Read the code, access the data

See the [`code`]() directory on GitHub for the source code that generated the figures and statistical results contained in the manuscript.
The raw data is stored on [Zenodo]() and [HydroSHEDS]() and will be downloaded when starting the analysis. 

## Install the R package

[![Build Status]()]()

This repository is organized as an R package, providing functions and raw data to reproduce and extend the analysis reported in the publication. 
Note that this package has been written explicitly for this project and may not be suitable for general use. 

This project is setup with a [drake workflow](https://github.com/ropensci/drake), ensuring reproducibility.
Intermediate targets/objects will be stored in a hidden `.drake` directory.

The R library of this project is managed by [packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/).
This makes sure that the exact same package versions are used when recreating the project.
When calling `packrat::restore()`, all required packages will be installed with their specific version.

Please note that this project was built with R version X.X.X on a Windows 10 operating system.
The packrat packages from this project **are not compatible with R versions prior version 3.5.0.**
  (In general, it should be possible to reproduce the analysis on any other operating system.)

To clone the project, a working installation of `git` is required.
Open a terminal in the directory of your choice and execute:
  
  ```sh
git clone git@github.com:messamat/globalIRmap.git
```

Then start R in this directory and run

```{r README-4, eval = FALSE}
packrat::restore() # restores all R packages with their specific version
r_make() # recreates the analysis
```

# Structure of the analysis

In the `drake` philosophy, every R object is a "target" with dependencies.
This repository contains more targets than actually needed to replicate the associated publication.

If you want to replicate the publication, you need to build the following targets:
