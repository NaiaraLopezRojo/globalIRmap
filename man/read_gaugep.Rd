\usage{
read_gaugep(
  inp_GRDCgaugep,
  inp_GSIMgaugep,
  inp_riveratlas2,
  in_monthlydischarge = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_monthlydischarge}{data frame of naturalized monthly discharge for
every river reach in HydroSHEDS}

\item{in_filestructure}{named list containing path to point data for gauging
stations, named \code{in_gaugep}}

\item{dist}{maximum distance from the river network beyond which gauging
stations are excluded.}
}
\value{
object of class \link[sf]{sf}
}
\description{
Import streamgauging station spatial data and attributes, only keeping those
whose point representation is within a given distance from the river network.
}
\details{
The distance from the river network must have been determined
beforehand and be an attribute of the gauge stations point data called
\code{station_river_distance}
}
